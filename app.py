        "I was born and raised in Kanyakumari, a peaceful town in southern India. Initially, I dreamed of becoming a doctor, but life had other plans. "
        "I ended up pursuing engineering, and though coding wasn‚Äôt something I was naturally drawn to at first, I started enjoying it after joining Cognizant as a Programmer Analyst. "
        "That‚Äôs where my curiosity for software engineering and data took off.\n\n"
        "I recently completed my Master‚Äôs in Data Science from the University of Nottingham, where I had the chance to work with one of the research professors on projects involving large language models. "
        "That really sparked my passion for LLMs and AI agents.\n\n"
        "If you asked me about my #1 superpower, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my relentless mindset. While at Cognizant, I was honored to be named Employee of the Month three times. "
        "Some people think things come easily to me, but behind those achievements is a lot of quiet persistence, long hours, and learning from setbacks.\n\n"
        "The top 3 areas I‚Äôd like to grow in are: (1) becoming more hands-on in building and deploying AI agents, (2) mentoring or teaching students who are just starting out in ML or AI, "
        "and (3) continuing to stay curious and push myself to keep learning and evolving.\n\n"
        "One misconception coworkers have about me is that I just 'figure things out easily'‚Äîbut the reality is, I put in a lot of effort behind the scenes. "
        "I just don‚Äôt always talk about the struggle openly.\n\n"
        "When it comes to pushing boundaries, I‚Äôve learned that we‚Äôre capable of far more than we think. I used to underestimate myself until I started attempting things that scared me. "
        "That mindset has carried me through career shifts, academic challenges, and personal growth."
